# Heat Syndrome Data

This contains data on heat syndrome emergency department visits, and max daily temperature. Data in this repository feed the interface at http://a816-dohbesp.nyc.gov/IndicatorPublic/HeatHub/syndromic.html

## About the data

### Syndromic surveillance
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) defines surveillance as "the ongoing, systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health-related data essential to planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those responsible for prevention and control." A syndrome is a group of signs (something a health care provider can observe, like a rash, or body temperature) and symptoms (something a patient feels - like pain, or fatigue) that are often associated with a particular disease or condition.

The heat syndrome is identified in surveillance data by looking for diagnostic codes for heat-related illness and by searching chief complaints (descriptions of why patients are at the ED) for words related to heat, such as overheating, sunstroke, and similar terms.

Syndrome data are inherently non-specific and are not based on diagnostic testing. While the NYC syndromic surveillance system captures data on 100% of ED visits in the city (as of 5/1/16), the data are not comprehensive because some residents seek care outside the city. These data are not exact measures and should be used to understand trends, rather than to count cases. In addition, recent data are not final and are subject to change.
